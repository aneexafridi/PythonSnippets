# ------------------Set Type
# A set is an unorder collection of elements much like a set in mathematics.
# The order of elements is not maintained in the sets.
# It means the elements may not appear in the same
# order as they are entered into set.
# A set does not accept duplicate elements.
# Set is mutable so we can Modify it.
# Sets are unorder so we can access its element using index.
# Sets are represented using curly brackets {}
# Sets are unorder so we can not access its elements using index
# Exameple Set = {1,2,"Equal",33,'A'}

Set = {1,2,"Equal",'A'}
