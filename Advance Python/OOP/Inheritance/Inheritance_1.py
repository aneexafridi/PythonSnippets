# --------------------Inheritance
# The mechanism of deriving a new class from an old one(existing class)
# such that the new class inherit all the members (variables and Methods)
# of old class is called Inheritance or derivation.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ----------------Super Class and Sub Class
# The old class is referred to as the Super class and the new one is called the sub class.
# >> Parent Class -- Base class or Super Class
# >> Child Class  -- Derived Class or Sub Class
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# >> All classes in python are built from a single super class called 'Object' so whenever
 # we create a class in python, object will become super class for them internally.
 # class class_Name(object):

 # The main Advantage of inheritance is code reusability.
